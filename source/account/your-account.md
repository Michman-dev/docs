# Your Account

[TOC]



## Two-Factor Authentication

You can set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) from your Michman [Account Settings Page][account-settings].
Once you enable 2FA - scan the QR code with your phone's 2FA app.

After enabling 2FA you will also be shown a number of recovery codes. Store the codes securely (we recommend using a password manager) -
they can be used instead of a generated code in case you lost access to your 2FA device.
Each code is single-use, codes can be regenerated at your account's page at any time.

:::
Offline phone application for generating 2FA codes - Google Authenticator:
- [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)

## Email and Password

You can chane your email or password from your Michman [Account Settings Page][account-settings].

Note that you can't change an email or a password if you're registered via OAuth. Please use your OAuth provider's security settings page.



## Deleting Your Account

You can delete your account and all the data at any time from your [Account Settings Page][account-settings].
