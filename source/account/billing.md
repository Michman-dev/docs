# Billing

[TOC]



## Subscription Plan and Payment Info

You can subscribe and change your plan as well as update your payment information on the Michman [Billing Page][billing].
We're using a third-party service Paddle to manage your payment information and never store or even see your card info.



## Downgrading

You can downgrade to a lower subscription plan from the Michman [Billing Page][billing]. Please note that it won't work if you currently have more servers than the lower plan allows.



## Business Receipts

If you need to add specific contact or tax information to your receipts such as your full business name, VAT number, or address of record you can add extra billing information on the [Billing Page][billing]. We'll make sure this information is displayed on every receipt.
