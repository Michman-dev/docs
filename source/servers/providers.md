Support for other server providers is coming soon!

## Connecting Server Providers

You can connect your server provider account from your account's [Server Providers Page][providers].
You may add a descriptive name in case you have multiple server providers accounts.

To link Michman to your DigitalOcean account go to your [DigitalOcean API Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)
